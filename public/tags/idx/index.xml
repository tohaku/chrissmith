      <description>ðŸ‘‹Â Hello! Welcome to my blog / personal website. If you have already guessed from the URL - which I was pretty lucky to snag (chris-smith.net) - Iâ€™m Chris. I created this site to record and share the various projects I might be working on or things that Iâ€™m learning. Itâ€™ll help chart my growth in different areas but also be a cool little time machine to look back. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on tons of projects that were eventually scrapped â€” and I regret not saving anything to look back on.</description>
