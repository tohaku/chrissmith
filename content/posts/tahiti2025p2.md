Day 5 had arrived and we planned to go out on a waterfall hike.  I'd been waiting for the waterfall hike to propose and had already been carrying the ring in my pocket for a couple of days.

This trip wasn't just about getting away but it was also about the proposal.  Before we had decided on Tahiti I had originally wanted New Zealand.  Aside from it being gorgeous it's also the place Lord of the Rings was filmed which is Becca's favorite movie series.  That plan feel through and my fallback was going to be the island of Mo'orea which was a short ferry ride outside of Tahiti.  Mo'orea eventually feel through because we didn't plan to stay there and the ferry times only ran until 2pm.  I'd picked out a specific beach and private dinner at a resort but I had no idea just how early things closed down in Tahiti.

So the fall back plan was the water fall hike.  We made our way south on the main road and circled the island counter clockwise for about 40 minutes.  Just as we're 5 minutes away from the trail head, we hit a road closure!  The storm from the previous couple of days had caused massive mud slides and had closed down this portion of the road blocking our way!  

With my plans foiled once again Becca mentions we should backtrack to a waterfall we'd seen while driving that was right off the road.  With some luck we get there and the only other people was a family who was already leaving. We had the falls to ourselves.  When parking there was a sign in French that mentioned the area was a private property that listed hours the public could visit.  We translated the sign and determined it was ok for us to go in. However while walking to the falls Becca was Googling a nearby trail next to the falls and in Google the trail said it was closed!

So while I'm planning my moves to mount my camera and capture the proposal on video, Becca starts freaking out that we're trespassing and wants to leave.  I of course with my hands up stop her and keep re-iterating no it's ok lets just get our photo at the falls first.  I set my phone on the ground and pretend to be trying to connect to it with my watch to take the photo.  Meanwhile I'm reaching for the ring in my pocket.  Becca was so distracted with wanting to leave and confused by my commotion, when I kneeled, she also started to kneel!  She quickly did realize what was happening and said yes!

We finish off the night with another beach sunset before grabbing myself some crepes and Becca a pizza from Le Foodcourt
